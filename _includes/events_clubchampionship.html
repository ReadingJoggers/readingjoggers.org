          <li>Reading Joggers Consistency League runs from April to March.</li>
          <li>The League will consist of local events spread reasonably evenly throughout the year.</li>

          <li>Everybody gets a WAVA (World Association of Veteran Athletes) score and the member with the highest score wins.</li>
          <li>The winner of each race is given 50 points and then down with second given 49 points, third 48 points and so on.</li> 
          <li>Each member can do as many races in the consistency league as they like, but only their best seven will count towards their final score. </li>
          <li>Members are advised to wear their club colours to be eligible for points. </li>
