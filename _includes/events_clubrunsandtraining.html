    <h3>Every Tue & Thur @ 7:00 PM </h3>
    Club members meet at
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b"
      target="_blank">Beansheaf Community Center, Reading, RG31 7AW</a> on Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7:00 pm for 7:20 start.
    <br>
    <br> Our regular Club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running groups to choose
    from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to about ~8 min/mile for the fastest.
    We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there is ample choice for runners and joggers of all
    abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland trails, canal and
    lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but choose the local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout the year,
    we offer pleasant running to anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a leader appointed by the Club Captain,
    or his deputy, to show the way around the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced runner to stay
    with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may happen, but it must be stressed that runners take
    part at their own risk.
    <br>
    <br> Exception:
    <br> On Thursdays the club runs training programs and this can take place at a different venue, details listed below.

    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b">Beansheaf Community Centre, RG31 7AW.</a>
    <br> Meet at 19:00 for 19:20 start

    <br>This session will be on grass.
    <br>
    <br>Meet at 19:00 for the session to start at 19:20
    <br>  
    <br>This is a minimum mileage activity which can prove as effective as Interval Training. It can improve the cardiovascular fitness as much as an hour of moderate level aerobic running ( Tuesday Evenings ) 
    <br>The short bouts of exercise can improve muscle fitness and performance comparable to several weeks of traditional endurance training if it was done on a regular basis. However we are going to use it as part of the overall training sessions.
    <br>It also improves the utilisation of oxygen to help the body rid itself of unwanted Lactic Acid
    <br> 
    <br>There will be a thorough warm up including some drills.
    <br> 
    <br>4 to 6 x 60 metre strides before you start the session.
    <br> 
    <br>6 x (Sprint 15 secs + 15 secs rest) at 75-85% effort.
    <br>2 minute rest before next set. 
    <br> 
    <br>6 x (Sprint 20 secs + 20 secs rest) at 85-90% effort
    <br>3 minute rest before next set. 
    <br> 
    <br>6 x (Sprint 25 secs + 30 secs rest) at 90-95% effort.
    <br>4 minute rest before next set.
    <br> 
    <br>2 x (Sprint 15 secs + 30 secs rest) at 95 + effort.
    <br> 
    <br>Possibly 2 sets or 1 complete set and part of the second set. This is a short session but it is hard.
    <br>Gentle warm down followed by stretch down to finish.
    <br> 
    <br>Aim:- To improve your aerobic and anaerobic capacity and running efficiency.
    <br> 
    <br>I will control this with a whistle

    <h3>Thursday 19th July 2018 : Kenyan Hills - Prospect Park</h3>
    Meet at
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Prospect+Park/@51.4482918,-1.0131572,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48769bbdeb5b73e5:0xdd1dd918a5735bc">Prospect Park, Main car park, RG30 2ND.</a>
    <br> Meet at 19:00 for 19:20 start
    <br> This session is a mixture of grass and trail.
    <br> 
    <br> Many runners have a love-hate relationship with hills, often because they approach them incorrectly. They try to charge up them as if they don’t exist in order to get them over with as soon as possible. Hills should be a test of patience and pacing to enable you to carry on at a comfortable pace and not to be gasping for air and slow up at the top. After all if you are going to be racing on hills (and there are not many races without a hill or two) then you should be training on them – not all the time, but frequently enough so that when you meet one in a race then you will know how to approach it.
    <br>  
    <br> Hill running is great for improving your running efficiency, because it can give you the strength training that you can get from short intervals, but it can also improve your running form. It forces you, or at least it should do, to get you on to the ball of your foot for the next push off. And don’t forget to use your arms to help you get up the hill, but stay relaxed.
    <br>  
    <br> When you run downhill, the problem is usually the opposite of running uphill, too much backward lean, Shifting your weight backwards is a normal reaction as it slows you down. As you run uphill, your whole body should lean into the hill, not just from your waist, your foot strike is shifted forward onto the sole of your foot where as running downhill forces your foot strike towards your heel and leaning back increases the braking effect and leads to more force going through your legs and possibly leading to injury. But since a downhill will give you a ‘free’ increase in your running speed, with gravity helping you, you will want to take advantage of this. As your speed increases your cadence will need to quicken. You will need to balance your speed from running downhill and running too fast that it upsets your pacing. You should not be out of breath at the bottom of the hill.
    <br>  
    <br> What do Kenyans Hills give you.....In short.... A better aerobic endurance, improved strength endurance, increased running economy, improved stride length and cadence.
    <br>  
    <br> This ideal pace is for you to be working at 80-85% of MHR (Maximum Heart Rate), or in plain English you should be able to utter 4-5 words at the top (if you're lucky).
    <br> 
    <br> The entire session will last 30-35 minutes plus the warm up, cool down and stretching.

    <br> This evening, we're looking to do something different... A treasure hunt tied into a run round Reading.... As a heads
    up, it won't your normal run, maybe 3-5 miles, depending on how far you think you'll get in an hour!
    <br>
    <br> You'll be given a map of sorts and asked to find certain things on route... and provide evidence.... and it'll end at
    the mansion house for dinner/drinks... a social run followed by a social...

    <br>
    <br> Split into teams, either on your own or on the night (TBC)… only stipulation is each "team" needs to carry a device
    that'll take photographs!
