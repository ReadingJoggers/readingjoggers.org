      target="_blank">Beansheaf Community Center, Reading, RG31 7AW</a> on Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7:00 pm for 7:20 start.
    <br>
    <br> Our regular Club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running groups to choose
    from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to about ~8 min/mile for the fastest.
    We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there is ample choice for runners and joggers of all
    abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland trails, canal and
    lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but choose the local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout the year,
    we offer pleasant running to anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a leader appointed by the Club Captain,
    or his deputy, to show the way around the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced runner to stay
    with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may happen, but it must be stressed that runners take
    part at their own risk.
    <br>
    <br> Exception:
    <br> On Thursdays the club runs training programs and this can take place at a different venue, details listed below.

    <br> This evening, we're looking to do something different... A treasure hunt tied into a run round Reading.... As a heads
    up, it won't your normal run, maybe 3-5 miles, depending on how far you think you'll get in an hour!
    <br>
    <br> You'll be given a map of sorts and asked to find certain things on route... and provide evidence.... and it'll end at
    the mansion house for dinner/drinks... a social run followed by a social...

    <br>
    <br> Split into teams, either on your own or on the night (TBC)â€¦ only stipulation is each "team" needs to carry a device
    that'll take photographs!
