      Park, Main Car Park, RG30 2ND</a>. Please see below for details.
    <br>
    <br>On Thursdays, in addition to a regular club run, we hold training sessions and our Summer Handicap series. The location
    and content of these sessions vary, so please see below for details.
    <br>
    <br>For all evening sessions, including training and the Summer Handicap, we meet at 7:00pm for a 7:20pm start.
    <br>
    <br> Our regular club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running groups to
    choose from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to about ~8 min/mile for the
    fastest. We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there is ample choice for runners and joggers
    of all abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland trails, canal
    and lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but choose the local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout the
    year, we offer pleasant running to anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a leader appointed by the Club
    Captain, or his deputy, to show the way around the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced runner
    to stay with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may happen, but it must be stressed that runners
    take part at their own risk.

    <h3>Thursday 27th September 2018 : High Intensity Training (HIT) - Theale</h3>
    Meet at
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Theale,+Reading,+West+Berkshire+RG7+5AG/@51.439206,-1.0712676,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876993a33b247bf:0x2e95038cb102ccd0">Old
      A4 at Theale, RG7 5AG.</a>
    <br> Session will start at 19:20
    <br>
    <br> This session will be on the old A4 at Theale. It is well lit.
    <br>
    <br>You can either meet at the Beansheaf Community Centre or at the session site.
    <br>
    <br>1. You can go over the junction 12 motorway roundabout, towards the Theale bypass, and turn right at the next roundabout
    towards Theale. At the T-junction mini roundabout turn right and park up near the barrier.
    <br>
    <br>2. If you decide to park at Beansheaf you can then jog to the session site as a warm up. You turn right into Sainsbury's
    and then left into Pincents Lane, passing Porche Cars to your right and Dunelm to your left and head towards the footbridge
    over the motorway. I shall be going direct to the site.
    <br>
    <br>( I did not mention this, but you could sneak into the multi-story Ikea or Sainsburys car parks and then walk over
    the motorway bridge)
    <br>
    <br>This is a minimum mileage activity which can prove as effective as Interval Training. It can improve the cardiovascular
    fitness as much as an hour of moderate level aerobic running ( Tuesday Evenings )
    <br>The short bouts of exercise can improve muscle fitness and performance comparable to several weeks of traditional
    endurance training if it was done on a regular basis. However we are going to use it as part of the overall training
    sessions.
    <br>It also improves the utilisation of oxygen to help the body rid itself of unwanted Lactic Acid
    <br>
    <br>There will be a thorough warm up including some drills.
    <br>
    <br>4 to 6 x 60 metre strides before you start the session.
    <br>
    <br>6 x (Sprint 15 secs + 15 secs rest) at 75-85% effort.
    <br>2 minute rest before next set.
    <br>
    <br>6 x (Sprint 20 secs + 20 secs rest) at 85-90% effort
    <br>3 minute rest before next set.
    <br>
    <br>8 x (Sprint 20 secs + 25 secs rest) at 90-95% effort.
    <br>4 minute rest before next set.
    <br>
    <br>2 x (Sprint 15 secs + 30 secs rest) at 95 + effort.
    <br>
    <br>Possibly 2 sets or 1 complete set and part of the second set. This is a short session but it is hard.
    <br>Gentle warm down followed by stretch down to finish.
    <br>
    <br>Aim:- To improve your aerobic and anaerobic capacity and running efficiency.
    <br>
    <br>I will control this with a whistle
