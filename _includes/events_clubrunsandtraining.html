                    target="_blank">Beansheaf Community Center, Reading, RG31 7AW</a> on Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7:00 pm for 7:20 start.
                  <br>
                  <br> Our regular Club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running
                  groups to choose from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to
                  about ~8 min/mile for the fastest. We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there
                  is ample choice for runners and joggers of all abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around
                  Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland trails, canal and lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but
                  choose the local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout the year, we offer pleasant running to
                  anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a leader appointed by the Club Captain, or his deputy,
                  to show the way around the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced runner to stay
                  with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may happen, but it must be stressed
                  that runners take part at their own risk.
                  <br>
                  <br> Exception:
                  <br> On Thursdays the club runs training programs and this can take place at a different venue, details listed
                  below.

    <br> Arthur has a long standing prior engagement and therefore shall not be able to lead a session.

    <br>
    <br> The club will be open as usual so it will be a normal club evening. Perhaps James the club captain will arrange one of his 'specials'. 
    
    <br>
    <br> There is also a 10K at Dinton Pastures

    <br> This is aimed at conditioning work and endurance especially muscular. This incorporates several exercises based on general mobility, general conditioning and leg conditioning. The recoveries are 100 metre runs at a brisk pace. This also improves the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

    <br> The nine exercises in the order they are to be done are:- (The exercises may change slightly)
     
    <br>
    <br> Bird Dog ( Mobility )

    <br>Push-ups countdown ( conditioning )
    <br>High Knees ( Legs )
    <br>Burpees ( Conditioning )
     
    <br>
    <br> As this session is hard, each exercise will last for about 20 seconds.
     
    <br>
    <br> Before each of the exercises you have a 100 metre run at a brisk pace (Recovery)
     
    <br>
    <br> After each set you jog about 500-600 metres before starting another set.

    <br>
    <br> This evening, we're looking to do something different... A treasure hunt tied into a run round Reading.... As a heads up, it won't your normal run, maybe 3-5 miles, depending on how far you think you'll get in an hour!
    <br>
    <br> You'll be given a map of sorts and asked to find certain things on route... and provide evidence.... and it'll end at the mansion house for dinner/drinks... a social run followed by a social...

    <br>
    <br> Split into teams, either on your own or on the night (tbc)â€¦ only stipulation is each "team" needs to carry a device that'll take photographs!
    
    <br>
    <br> Be nice to get people out for this!
