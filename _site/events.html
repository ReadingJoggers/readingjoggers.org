    <h3>Every Tue & Thur @ 7:00 PM </h3>
    Club members meet at
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b"
      target="_blank">Beansheaf Community Center, Reading, RG31 7AW</a> on Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7:00 pm for 7:20 start.
    <br>
    <br> Our regular Club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running groups to choose
    from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to about ~8 min/mile for the fastest.
    We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there is ample choice for runners and joggers of all
    abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland trails, canal and
    lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but choose the local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout the year,
    we offer pleasant running to anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a leader appointed by the Club Captain,
    or his deputy, to show the way around the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced runner to stay
    with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may happen, but it must be stressed that runners take
    part at their own risk.
    <br>
    <br> Exception:
    <br> On Thursdays the club runs training programs and this can take place at a different venue, details listed below.

    <h3>Thursday 2nd August 2018 : Zigzag Runs - Beansheaf</h3>
    Meet at
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b">Beansheaf Community Centre, RG31 7AW.</a>
    <br> Meet at 19:00 for 19:20 start
    <br>
    <br>This session will be on grass.
    <br>
    <br>This can be either a speed and acceleration drill or a strength-endurance session. This is dependent of the length of
    the zigzags. This session will be for strength-endurance. A series of six markers are placed at approximately 60m intervals.
    Six 60m sprints are made with approximately 90 degree turns around each marker. Because you have to decelerate to get
    round each marker and then accelerate to the next marker, this will improve both your co-ordination, strength and ability
    to accelerate. As a bonus this will help you in a race situation. You will then jog or walk back (the long three sided
    way) back to the start. Each set will consist of 4 or 5 runs and then a complete recovery of 4-5 minutes before the next
    set. There will be 2 or 3 sets. The long recovery will ensure maximum intensity for each set.
    <br>
    <br>The time for this session will be 35-40 minutes.

    <h3>Thursday 23rd August 2018 : Kenyan Hills - Prospect Park</h3>
    <br>Meet at
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Prospect+Park/@51.4482918,-1.0131572,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48769bbdeb5b73e5:0xdd1dd918a5735bc">Prospect Park, Main car park, RG30 2ND.</a>
    <br> Meet at 19:00 for 19:20 start
    <br> This session is a mixture of grass and trail.
    <br>
    <br> Many runners have a love-hate relationship with hills, often because they approach them incorrectly. They try to charge
    up them as if they don’t exist in order to get them over with as soon as possible. Hills should be a test of patience
    and pacing to enable you to carry on at a comfortable pace and not to be gasping for air and slow up at the top. After
    all if you are going to be racing on hills (and there are not many races without a hill or two) then you should be training
    on them – not all the time, but frequently enough so that when you meet one in a race then you will know how to approach
    it.
    <br>
    <br> Hill running is great for improving your running efficiency, because it can give you the strength training that you
    can get from short intervals, but it can also improve your running form. It forces you, or at least it should do, to
    get you on to the ball of your foot for the next push off. And don’t forget to use your arms to help you get up the hill,
    but stay relaxed.
    <br>
    <br> When you run downhill, the problem is usually the opposite of running uphill, too much backward lean, Shifting your
    weight backwards is a normal reaction as it slows you down. As you run uphill, your whole body should lean into the hill,
    not just from your waist, your foot strike is shifted forward onto the sole of your foot where as running downhill forces
    your foot strike towards your heel and leaning back increases the braking effect and leads to more force going through
    your legs and possibly leading to injury. But since a downhill will give you a ‘free’ increase in your running speed,
    with gravity helping you, you will want to take advantage of this. As your speed increases your cadence will need to
    quicken. You will need to balance your speed from running downhill and running too fast that it upsets your pacing. You
    should not be out of breath at the bottom of the hill.
    <br>
    <br> What do Kenyans Hills give you.....In short.... A better aerobic endurance, improved strength endurance, increased running
    economy, improved stride length and cadence.
    <br>
    <br> This ideal pace is for you to be working at 80-85% of MHR (Maximum Heart Rate), or in plain English you should be able
    to utter 4-5 words at the top (if you're lucky).
    <br>
    <br> The entire session will last 30-35 minutes plus the warm up, cool down and stretching.

    <h3>Thursday 30th August 2018 : 400 - 800m Intervals (or 800m intervals) - Beansheaf</h3>
    Meet at
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b">Beansheaf Community Centre, RG31 7AW.</a>
    <br> Meet at 19:00 for 19:20 start
    <br>
    <br> This session will be held on THE CHASE (about 800m from Beansheaf - you can partly warm up getting there).
    <br> It is run between Grangely Close and Kettering Close.
    <br>
    <br> 400m - 800m - 400m - 800m ...........
    <br>
    <br> Start with 400m followed by 30 second jog recovery. Then 800m followed by 60 seconds jog recovery.
    <br>
    <br> Repeat above until time set of 35-40 minutes is finished.
    <br>
    <br> Based on 10K race speed (which means you will be going a little faster than your 10K pace. See example below). It would
    help if you can remember your latest 10K time.
    <br>
    <br> Example:- If your 10K race speed is 50:00 then your 400/800m time is 2:00/4:00. Your target would be 1:55/3:50. This
    involves a gentle uphill and downhill
