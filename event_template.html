                     Meet at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Prospect+Park/@51.4482918,-1.0131572,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48769bbdeb5b73e5:0xdd1dd918a5735bc">Prospect Park, Main car park, RG30 2ND.</a><br>
                     Meet at 19:00 for 19:20 start<br>
                     <br>
                     It is dependant on the state of the ground if we are going to do Kenyan Hills tonight.  If the area is unsuitable we will still do a session in Prospect Park.<br>

                     Many runners have a love-hate relationship with hills, often because they approach them incorrectly. They try to charge up them as if they don’t exist in order to get them over with as soon as possible. Hills should be a test of patience and pacing to enable you to carry on at a comfortable pace and not to be gasping for air and slow up at the top. After all if you are going to be racing on hills (and there are not many races without a hill or two) then you should be training on them – not all the time, but frequently enough so that when you meet one in a race then you will know how to approach it.<br>

                     Hill running is great for improving your running efficiency, because it can give you the strength training that you can get from short intervals, but it can also improve your running form. It forces you, or at least it should do, to get you on to the ball of your foot for the next push off. And don’t forget to use your arms to help you get up the hill, but stay relaxed.<br><br>
                      
                     What do Kenyans Hills give you.....In short.... A better aerobic endurance, improved strength endurance, increased running economy, improved stride length and cadence.<br>
                     This ideal pace is for you to be working at 80-85% of MHR (Maximum Heart Rate), or in plain English you should be able to utter 4-5 words at the top (if you're lucky).<br>
                     The entire session will last 30-35 minutes plus the warm up, cool down and stretching.

                     Four separate Hills, each with their own characteristics, and each requires a different technique to run each one. They are Haywood Way, Fontwell Drive, Lingholm Close and Mandeville Close. The third hill (Lingholm Close) will be used for downhill reps.<br>
                     There will be 9-10 minutes on each hill, with the recovery being taken going on to the next hill.<br>
                     Hill running is good for improving your running efficiency as it not only improves your strength, but also your running form.<br>

                     <br>
                     This is a minimum mileage activity which can prove as effective as Interval Training. It can improve the cardiovascular fitness as much as an hour of  moderate level aerobic running. 
                     The short bouts of exercise can improve muscle fitness and performance comparable to several weeks of traditional endurance training if it was done on a regular basis. However we are going to use it as part of the overall training sessions.
                     It also improves the utilisation of oxygen to help the body rid itself of unwanted Lactic Acid<br><br>
                     There will be a thorough warm up including some drills.

                     As the circuit is 500m it is ideal for tonight's session.<br>
                     The first 400m is at just under 10K pace and the final 100m at a faster pace. You then continue on for another 400mm with the last 100m again at a faster pace. Each 1000m will be followed by a 2 minute recovery. The faster 100m is NOT an all out sprint. <br> 
                     During your recovery period, keep moving, walk or a very gentle jog and please do not stay on the path, to allow others to pass freely.<br><br>
                     The session will last 35-40 Minutes.

                     Session will start at 19:20<br>
                     <br>
                     The session tonight will be held on a circuit of approximately 950 metres of mainly gravel paths. This will be marked with flour although it is a straight forward course.<br> 
                     Run 750 to 800m at 10K pace, and the last 150 to 200m at a slightly faster pace (the sting in the tail), then recover for 200m at a relaxed pace.<br>
                     Ideally each Scorpion should be at the same pace, (ideally 10K pace) that is all the first 750 to 800m and the faster 150 to 200m should all be the same pace.<br>
                     It would be advantageous if you wore a watch as consistency is the target.

                     Meet at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b">Beansheaf Community Centre, RG31 7AW.</a><br>
                     Session will start at 19:20<br>
                     <br>
                     This can be either a speed and acceleration drill or a strength-endurance session. This is dependent of the length of the zigzags. This session will be for strength-endurance. A series of six markers are placed at approximately 60m intervals. Six 60m sprints are made with approximately 90 degree turns around each marker. Because you have to decelerate to get round each marker and then accelerate to the next marker, this will improve both your co-ordination, strength and ability to accelerate. As a bonus this will help you in a race situation. You will then jog or walk back (the long three sided way) back to the start. Each set will consist of 4 or 5 runs and then a complete recovery of 4-5 minutes before the next set. There will be 2 or 3 sets. The long recovery will ensure maximum intensity for each set. <br>
                     The time for this session will be 35-40 minutes.<br>
                     This session will be on grass.

                     <br>
                     This is a speed session. Each interval should be treated as an individual 'race'.<br>
                     Provided there are not too many whistles being blown at the track I will control this with a whistle. The coach for the university also uses whistles to control the session.<br> 
                     Bring a Watch but I will call out your time as you cross the finish line. You should try to keep each interval as near as possible to your time on the last 200/300 interval.<br><br>
                     Why are we doing this is a question you are probably asking yourselves as mainly endurance runners.<br>
                     ALL endurance runners need to do this type of session otherwise your body will get so used to churning out the miles at one pace that when you need to up the pace your legs and body will not react.<br>
