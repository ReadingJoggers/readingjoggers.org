            I joined Reading Joggers in 2012 after reality set in, either diet
            for the rest of my life or move. I hadn’t run for many years. I can
            honestly say that running has given me back my life. I have since
            become a member of the 100marathon club, something I would never
            have imagined in a million years. The passion I have for running is
            immense, I love the wellbeing it gives me, the community spirit it
            provides and helping and inspiring people to achieve goals. I’m
            usually in the slower group but hey I’m out there and totally
            enjoying it.

            My name is Mike Goff and I’ve been a member of Reading Joggers for 4
            years. I run with the club most weeks and take part in many of the
            local races. I regularly run and volunteer at Prospect parkrun.
            Reading Joggers has been brilliant for giving me the motivation and
            knowledge to become a stronger runner and has helped ensure that
            running remains a pleasure not a chore. Since I joined I’ve steadily
            tried to become more actively involved in the club, starting with
            regularly leading one of the Tuesday night groups and culminating in
            become a committee member for the first time this year (2019). I
            hope to carry on the good work of my predecessors and ensure that
            the club remains friendly, welcoming and beneficial to all.

            Hi, I'm Nick Steward and am responsible for the Reading Joggers club
            kit.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined the club in 2010 to get fit for the coming hockey season...
            but I ended up staying and haven't played hockey since!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've gone from shorter distances to longer runs which I probably
            enjoy the most. Our club is friendly and all-welcoming. We have
            great coaches and our members range from Team GB ultra-runners, 100
            Marathon Club members to social runners who enjoy a gentle jog
            around Tilehurst and Calcot on a Tuesday evening!
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years I've probably used nearly every type of running
            garment there is, so hopefully I'm well suited to look after our kit
            and am always happy to give any tips and recommendations!

            I love running, simple! I’m excited to have joined the committee to
            give something back to Reading Joggers - a club that has given me so
            much… a love for running in the woods…the support to train and run
            the London Marathon, something I always thought was totally out of
            reach, the opportunity to run for 24 hours in Wasing Park… I could
            go on! Reading Joggers is a fab club, one I’m proud to be a part of
            and I’m looking forward to processing all your membership documents!

              Since taking up running in 2011, I have found running to be such a
              life-enhancer. I've been a member of Reading Joggers since 2015
              and love being part of this fun and friendly club. The club has
              also helped me reach some of my running goals and I would
              recommend you to come along whether you’re starting on a couch to
              5k or looking for qualifying times for a Major Marathon. I hope to
              see you soon!
