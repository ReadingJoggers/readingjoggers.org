This session will be held on <a routerLink="/find-us/other-locations">The Chase</a> (about 800m from Beansheaf - you can partly warm up getting there).
   
It is run between Grangely Close and Kettering Close.
     
Start with 400m followed by 30 second jog recovery. Then 800m followed by 60 seconds jog recovery.
     
Repeat above until time set of 35-40 minutes is finished.
    
Based on 10K race speed (which means you will be going a little faster than your 10K pace. See example below). It would help if you can remember your latest 10K time.
   
Example: If your 10K race speed is 50:00 then your 400/800m time is 2:00/4:00. Your target would be 1:55/3:50. This involves a gentle uphill and downhill.
