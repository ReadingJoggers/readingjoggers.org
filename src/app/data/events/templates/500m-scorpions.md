This session based on Lansdowne Road and Grafton Road, which lies between Mayfair and Halls Road.
 
As the circuit is 500m it is ideal for tonight's session.
 
The first 400m is at just under 10K pace and the final 100m at a faster pace. Each 500m will be followed by a 2 minute recovery. The faster 100m is NOT an all out sprint, but more like your finishing burst at the end of a race.
 
The session will last 35-40 Minutes.
 
During your recovery period, keep moving, walk or a very gentle jog and please do not stay on the path, to allow others to pass freely.
 
About 600-700 metres west of the Meadway Sports Centre you turn left off The Meadway into Halls Road.
Take the second right off Halls Road into Burlington Road.
At the end of Burlington Road is Lansdowne Road. Park safely on Lansdowne Road, but please do not block entrances to driveways.
You can also approach it from Langley Hill. Up Langley Hill to the roundabout and turn right into Halls Road.
Then take the second left into Burlington Road. (The post code for Burlington Road is RG30 4QG)
