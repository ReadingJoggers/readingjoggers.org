As we are entering (I hope) the warmer part of the year I thought it may be an ideal opportunity to see how fit you all are.

I shall ask you to take part in a Multistage Fitness Test (MFST). This is a maximal test which means it will take you to your fitness limit.

The test is used by coaches to estimate an athletes VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake).

I hope I have not put you off taking the test.

As I need a nice flat area which is also non slip in the wet I hope the area I have picked is not in use. If it is in use there is another area but means the group may have to split, which could be an advantage as those waiting can cheer the others on.

I will not be able to give you your results on the night as they have to be worked out.

I would advise you to bring something warm to put on in case you have to wait after you have warmed up.
