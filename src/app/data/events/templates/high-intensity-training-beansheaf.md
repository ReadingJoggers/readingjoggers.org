This session will be on grass.
     
This is a minimum mileage activity which can prove as effective as Interval Training. It can improve the cardiovascular fitness as much as an hour of moderate level aerobic running (Tuesday evenings) The short bouts of exercise can improve muscle fitness and performance comparable to several weeks of traditional endurance training if it was done on a regular basis. However we are going to use it as part of the overall training sessions. It also improves the utilisation of oxygen to help the body rid itself of unwanted lactic acid.
     
There will be a thorough warm up including some drills.
      
* 4 to 6 x 60 metre strides before you start the session
* 6 x (Sprint 15 secs + 15 secs rest) at 75-85% effort
