This session is a mixture of grass and trail.
 
Due to the evenings drawing in this will be the last of the Kenyan Hills in Prospect Park for the 2019 season.
 
There are three possible courses that we use which are dependent on the weather.
 
The long course is about 1700 metres, the middle is about 1400 metres and the shorter one about 900 metres.
 
As you start and finish in the same place the ups and downs are the same, but there is very little flat, if any.
 
What do Kenyans Hills give you.....In short.... A better aerobic endurance, improved strength endurance, increased running economy, improved stride length and cadence. It will also improve your technique of running up and down hills.
 
This ideal pace is for you to be working at 80-85% of MHR (Maximum Heart Rate), or in plain English you should be able to utter 4-5 words at the top of a hill (if you're lucky).
 
The entire session will last 30-35 minutes plus the warm up, cool down and stretching.
