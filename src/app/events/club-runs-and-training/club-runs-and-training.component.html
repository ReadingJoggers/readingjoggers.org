<h2>Club Runs & Training</h2>

    >Prospect Park, Main Car Park, RG30 2ND</a
  >. Please see below for details.
</p>
<p>
  On <strong>Thursdays</strong>, in addition to a regular club run, we hold
  training sessions and our
  <a routerLink="/events/summer-handicap">Summer Handicap</a> series. The
  location and content of these sessions vary, so please see below for details.
</p>
<p>
  For all evening sessions, including training and the Summer Handicap, we meet
  at 7:00pm for a 7:20pm start.
</p>
<p>
  Our regular club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles.
  There are several running groups to choose from and each group runs at a
  different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to about ~8 min/mile for
  the fastest. We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so
  there is ample choice for runners and joggers of all abilities. We use a dozen
  or more well-tried routes around Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland
  trails, canal and lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but choose the
  local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout the year, we offer
  pleasant running to anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a
  leader appointed by the Club Captain, or his deputy, to show the way around
  the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced runner to
  stay with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may
  happen, but it must be stressed that runners take part at their own risk.

        hard. If you are doing the Half on Sunday then come along and turn your
        legs over to make sure everything is in working order. If it is your

      This is a minimum mileage activity which can prove as effective as
      Interval Training. It can improve the cardiovascular fitness as much as an
      hour of moderate level aerobic running (Tuesday evenings) The short bouts
      of exercise can improve muscle fitness and performance comparable to
      several weeks of traditional endurance training if it was done on a
      regular basis. However we are going to use it as part of the overall
      training sessions. It also improves the utilisation of oxygen to help the
      body rid itself of unwanted lactic acid.
