          >"I know it is the Reading Half Marathon on Sunday and some of you may
          be thinking I will give this session a miss. Please do not, as it will
          be an ideal last workout before Sunday as long as you do not push it too
          hard. If you are doing the Half on Sunday then come along and turn your
          legs over to make sure everything is in working order. If it is your
          first Half Marathon and you have any questions please ask me and I will
          try to answer and reassure you. See you tonight." - Arthur</em

        This session will be held on <a routerLink="/find-us/other-locations">The Chase</a> (about 800m from Beansheaf - you
        can partly warm up getting there).

        Start with 400m followed by 30 second jog recovery. Then 800m followed by
        60 seconds jog recovery.

        Based on 10K race speed (which means you will be going a little faster
        than your 10K pace. See example below). It would help if you can remember
        your latest 10K time.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Example: If your 10K race speed is 50:00 then your 400/800m time is
        2:00/4:00. Your target would be 1:55/3:50. This involves a gentle uphill
        and downhill.
