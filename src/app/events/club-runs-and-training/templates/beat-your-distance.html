        1. You can go over the junction 12 motorway roundabout, towards the Theale
        bypass, and turn right at the next roundabout towards Theale. At the

        2. If you decide to park at Beansheaf you can then jog to the session site
        as a warm up. You turn right into Sainsbury's and then left into Pincents
        Lane, passing Porsche Cars to your right and Dunelm to your left and head
        towards the footbridge over the motorway. Arthur will be going direct to
        the site.

        Fast becoming a favourite session, but limited during the winter because
        of finding enough space that is lit. It is run over 200m laps (300 or 400m
        in the summer).
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        You will run for three minutes and then you will have a two minute active
        recovery.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">there will be 5 or 6 sets in total.</p>
      <p class="card-text">
        There will be a thorough warm up including some drills.
