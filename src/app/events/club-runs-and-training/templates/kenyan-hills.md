This session is a mixture of grass and trail.

Many runners have a love-hate relationship with hills, often because they approach them incorrectly. They try to charge up them as if they don’t exist in order to get them over with as soon as possible. Hills should be a test of patience and pacing to enable you to carry on at a comfortable pace and not to be gasping for air and slow up at the top. After all if you are going to be racing on hills (and there are not many races without a hill or two) then you should be training on them – not all the time, but frequently enough so that when you meet one in a race then you will know how to approach it.

Hill running is great for improving your running efficiency, because it can give you the strength training that you can get from short intervals, but it can also improve your running form. It forces you, or at least it should do, to get you on to the ball of your foot for the next push off. And don’t forget to use your arms to help you get up the hill, but stay relaxed.

When you run downhill, the problem is usually the opposite of running uphill, too much backward lean, Shifting your weight backwards is a normal reaction as it slows you down. As you run uphill, your whole body should lean into the hill, not just from your waist, your foot strike is shifted forward onto the sole of your foot where as running downhill forces your foot strike towards your heel and leaning back increases the braking effect and leads to more force going through your legs and possibly leading to injury. But since a downhill will give you a ‘free’ increase in your running speed, with gravity helping you, you will want to take advantage of this. As your speed increases your cadence will need to quicken. You will need to balance your speed from running downhill and running too fast that it upsets your pacing. You should not be out of breath at the bottom of the hill.

What do Kenyans Hills give you.....In short.... A better aerobic endurance, improved strength endurance, increased running economy, improved stride length and cadence.

This ideal pace is for you to be working at 80-85% of MHR (Maximum Heart Rate), or in plain English you should be able to utter 4-5 words at the top (if you're lucky).

The entire session will last 30-35 minutes plus the warm up, cool down and stretching.
