        This can be either a speed and acceleration drill or a strength-endurance session. This is dependent of the length of the zigzags. This session will be for strength-endurance. A series of six markers are placed at approximately 60m intervals. Six 60m sprints are made with approximately 90 degree turns around each marker. Because you have to decelerate to get round each marker and then accelerate to the next marker, this will improve your co-ordination, strength and ability to accelerate. As a bonus this will help you in a race situation. You will then jog or walk back (the long three sided way) back to the start. Each set will consist of 4 or 5 runs and then a complete recovery of 4-5 minutes before the next set. There will be 2 or 3 sets. The long recovery will ensure maximum intensity for each set.
