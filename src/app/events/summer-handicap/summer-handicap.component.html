<h2>Summer Handicap</h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  The 33rd Reading Joggers Summer Handicap Series is now complete.
</div>



<p>
  We meet at the main car park in
  <a routerLink="/find-us/prospect-park">Prospect Park</a>, at 7:00pm. Our aim is to get the first runners away by 7:20pm.
</p>

<h4>Schedule</h4>

<p>
    We have tried to avoid local events, including the Dinton Pastures 5/10K and
    the Thames 10K events, which now take place on Thursdays.
  </p>

<ul>
  <li>Summer Handicap 1 (2.5 miles) - Thursday 11th April 2019</li>
  <li>Summer Handicap 2 (5 miles) - Thursday 2nd May 2019</li>
  <li>Summer Handicap 3 (5 miles) - Thursday 23rd May 2019</li>
  <li>Summer Handicap 4 (5 miles) - Thursday 6th June 2019</li>
  <li>Summer Handicap 5 (5 miles) - Thursday 27th June 2019</li>
  <li>Summer Handicap 6 (5 miles) - Thursday 25th July 2019</li>
  <li>Summer Handicap 7 (5 miles) - Thursday 15th August 2019</li>
  <li>Summer Handicap 8 (2.5 miles) - Thursday 5th September 2019</li>
</ul>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>
  You need to run a minimum of <strong>four</strong> races as your best four results will count
  towards your final points total.
</p>

<p>
  If you have <strong>not</strong> taken part in the Handicap Series before <em>or</em> if you have not
  completed a race during the 2018 series you will have to complete <strong>five</strong> races. The extra race is needed to work out your handicap.
</p>

<p>
  We will start you off in two minute intervals and ask that you are ready to
  start when your time comes around. Please do not ask to start in another 2
  minute group as it will our life a lot easier and less likely that you are
  given the wrong time at the end.
</p>

<p>Points are awarded as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 point for first place</li>
  <li>2 points for second place</li>
  <li>3 points for third place</li>
  <li>and so on...</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thus if there are 25 members taking part, the last place will score 25
  points.
</p>
<p>
  So the winner at the end of the season will be the member with the lowest
  number of points who has completed the required number of races, (4 if you ran last season or 5
  if you did not).
</p>

<p>
  Please note that MEMBERS ONLY will be awarded points, but guests will be
  welcome to take part, and they will be included in the results as guest
  runners.
</p>

<p>PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND NOTE THAT YOU TAKE PART ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK</p>

<p>
  After the Handicap some of the members visit the Mansion House to replace some
  lost fluid.
</p>

<h4>Course</h4>

<p>
  The course is accurately measured and comprises of one lap for the 2.5 miles
  and two laps for the 5 miles.
</p>
<p>The course is also clearly marked with green spots and arrows.</p>

<p>
  The course uses the paths within Prospect Park and also the pavements on the
  outside of the park. You will have to cross two side roads off Leibenrood Road
  on each lap and the entrance to Prospect Park Hospital in Honey End Lane. You
  will also have to run on part of the road leading up to the Mansion House from
  the entrance to the park. On the two lap five mile course you will have to
  cross this road once, but there is a zebra crossing. There will be CAUTION
  RUNNERS signs on this road and near to the entrance of the park.
