<h2>Winter Handicap</h2>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">The 29th season (2019-2020) of the Reading Joggers Winter Handicap is now
  underway.</div>
<p>By popular request the Winter Handicap will be on a new course this year. Additionally Mike Goff will be running the
  event this year.</p>
<p>The course starts at the Pangbourne Rec Car Park (RG8 7BY), and then progresses to Sulham Woods where you do 'lap 2'
  of the old course. The return is by the same route. We meet at at 9:20am for 9:30am start. After a briefing, the first
  runners will be away by 9:40am.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will meet in the (free) Pangbourne Rec Car Park (RG8 7BY) to start at 9.20 am. Other Pangbourne car parks are
    also available and free on a Sunday. Please carshare as much as possible.</li>
  <li>The course is approximately 6.7 miles and is multiterrain. Please wear appropriate shoes and clothing if wet/cold.
    It is not suitable for spikes. </li>
  <li>There is one road crossing on the new route - please take care.</li>
  <li>If you have not yet tried the winter handicaps it is a good run with a couple of hills and it could be wet, muddy
    and slippery. There are also tree roots so care is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>The course is marked with flour to show the route only. As it is new there will be printed copies of route
      handy for the first few.</strong></li>
  <li>As is common with a cross-country course, there may be hidden roots or slippery areas, so please take care.
    <strong>All participants run at their own risk.</strong></li>
  <li>After the run we will meet at tba Pangbourne Cafe for hot drinks and cakes. </li>
</ul>
<p>This year there will be 6 Winter handicaps. Your best <strong>three</strong> finishes will count in the final
  placings. But if you have not taken part in the winter series before, did not run last season or complete the full
  distance you will need to run 4 of them. We need the extra race to establish a handicap for you. This is the reason
  your name may not appear in the list below. </p>
<p>Please note that <strong>only fully paid up members will be eligible for points</strong> but guests are welcome to
  take part in a maximum of 2 runs before being required to join the club and pay the membership fee. </p>
<p>Those taking part will be sent off in small groups roughly related to your handicap time. </p>
<p><strong>At the end, please make a note of your time as a back-up to the results.</strong> </p>
<h4>Volunteers</h4>
<p>This handicap will only run if we have sufficient volunteers to help mark the course (you can still run!) and/or run
  the event. Please let us know if you can help via email or facebook. We need 2 people to help mark per week for a ~8
  am start. </p>
<p>Marker one will do the section from Pangbourne to Beech Road (approx 2 miles each way) </p>
<p>Marker two will do the Sulham Woods section (start from Sulham Woods car park) (approx 2 miles total) </p>
<h4>Handicap Times</h4>
<p>Extensive testing has revealed the new route is about 4 min 30 seconds quicker then the old one so the old handicaps
  have being appropriately adjusted. </p>
<p>For this year we have simplified the calculation of your handicap to be the average of your handicap prior to your
  last run, and your last run time.</p>
